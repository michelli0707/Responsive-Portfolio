    <p> My name is Michelli Chaves Vieira. I am currently enrolled at a 24-week, 264 in-class hours Coding Boot Camp offered by SMU in Dallas TX. I am learning programming languages to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  
    </p>
    <p> I am a leader, self-starter and big-picture thinker by nature, with excellent problem-solving skills. I am also a technology, health & energy healing enthusiast, and a humanitarian at heart.     
    </p>
    <p> I have a major in International Business & Economics, and currently hold FINRA Series 7 and 66 licenses. I have 10 years of experience in new Business Development and Sales, both nationally and internationally, where I successfully sold Bloomberg software and networking technology to Director, VP and C-level executives in the Fortune 500 and 1000 lists. 
    </p>
    <p> I have successfully developed business in both the United States and the European Union, working with International Carriers, Telecom Operators, Cable MSOs and Colocation companies as well as International Banks, Broker-Dealers, Hedge Funds and Family Offices.
    </p>
    <p> Skills that I will attain at the end of this coding boot camp program: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, APIs, Firebase, Responsive Design, Git, MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Security and Session Storage, User Authentication, Heroku, MySQL.
